# Journey_to_Best_Strategies_to_Everyday_Life

## Dealing with Home Improvement
* Deal with the problem when it comes
* (speculation) Because there are just so many little things in the house. If you want to learn ahead of time how to fix them, there are just too many details that it is impossible. 2. Also, because usually any fixes might not need urgent attention, you might (speculation) have the luxury of time to look up how to repair.

## Dealing with Digital Equipment

## Dealing with personal finance

## Dealing with Privacy
* If it's in your domain of management, maybe personal social media, or website, you have to take ownership of managing your own privacy. If it's under other organization's management, you just have to trust them to manage it in good faith. The only way for you to deal with privacy from external organizations is your right to be forgotten.

## Dealing with Screen Time Management
* If you scroll on social media and start to feel anxious, or angry, or any exccessive negative emotion. Think of it as a threshold. Just stop scrolling and get back to the physical world. You are fine and your surrounding is fine. Don't let what you see that happens somewhere so far away to affect you. The reason you should stop is that if you keep scrolling and see you, you might be likely going to search more about the information, and you get more anxious, and you search more then. It will be a vicious cycle. Also, why think of it as a threshold is because you don't want to be reactive to the stuff you scroll. Hypoetheically you see something you don't like and immediately avoid it, or worse react on it, you will become less and less informed. Build a threshold, so you can protect your peace at the same time be somewhat informed.
